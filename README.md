Brahmin Cowsay 0.1
==================

Inspired by the new chapter in the Fallout series, and the upcoming release of Ansible 2 -- we've made the Brahmin Cowsay!

Now you too can have your ansible runs decorated with the great dual headed icon.

To use this with Ansible:

1. Place in a good spot.
2. `export COWPATH=<path to your good spot>`
3. `export ANSIBLE_COW_SELECTION=brahmin.cow`
4. Enjoy.

The Cow:

```

  (__)
  (oo)(__)------.
  (__)(oo)       )\/\
      (__)----w |
        ||     ||

```
